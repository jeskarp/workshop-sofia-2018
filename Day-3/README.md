# Ebola Simulation Case Study: early outbreak response

This case study will focus on the tools necessary for an early outbreak response
analysis. The first thing you should do for this case study is to open Rstudio
and create a new project in this folder for you to follow along. 

Once you've created your Rstudio project inside the `Day-3/` directory, create
three folders called `data/`, `reports/`, and `scripts/`.
